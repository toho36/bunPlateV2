### Task Management Templates

#### Feature Development Template

```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]

### Requirements

- [ ] Functional requirements defined
- [ ] Non-functional requirements specified
- [ ] Acceptance criteria documented
- [ ] Dependencies identified

### Development Tasks

- [ ] Frontend: UI components and interactions
- [ ] Fullstack: API endpoints and data handling
- [ ] Testing: Unit and integration tests
- [ ] DevOps: Deployment and monitoring setup
- [ ] Code Review: Security and quality validation

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Stakeholder approval received
```

#### Bug Fix Template

```markdown
## Bug: [Bug Description]

### Problem Statement

- Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
- Affected users: [User groups]
- Reproduction steps: [Steps to reproduce]

### Investigation Tasks

- [ ] Root cause analysis
- [ ] Impact assessment
- [ ] Solution design

### Resolution Tasks

- [ ] Fix implementation
- [ ] Regression testing
- [ ] Documentation update
- [ ] Deployment coordination
```

## Planning Methodologies

### Agile Sprint Planning

```
Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
Sprint Planning: Monday (2 hours)
Daily Standups: Daily (15 minutes)
Sprint Review: Friday (1 hour)
Sprint Retrospective: Friday (30 minutes)
```

### Story Estimation

- **Story Points**: Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- **T-shirt Sizing**: XS, S, M, L, XL for epics
- **Time Boxing**: Maximum 8 hours for any single task

### Priority Framework

1. **Critical** - Blocking issues, security vulnerabilities
2. **High** - Core features, user-facing improvements
3. **Medium** - Performance optimizations, technical debt
4. **Low** - Nice-to-have features, code cleanup

## Coordination Strategies

### Agent Handoff Management

```typescript
interface TaskHandoff {
  fromAgent: AgentType;
  toAgent: AgentType;
  deliverables: string[];
  acceptanceCriteria: string[];
  dependencies: string[];
  timeline: string;
}

// Example: Frontend to Fullstack handoff
const uiToApiHandoff: TaskHandoff = {
  fromAgent: "frontend",
  toAgent: "fullstack",
  deliverables: ["UI mockups", "Component interfaces", "API requirements"],
  acceptanceCriteria: ["API endpoints defined", "Data structures agreed"],
  dependencies: ["Database schema finalized"],
  timeline: "2 days",
};
```

### Parallel Work Coordination

- **Frontend & Testing**: Component development with test writing
- **Fullstack & DevOps**: API development with deployment setup
- **Code Review & All**: Continuous review throughout development
- **Documentation**: Updated incrementally by all agents

### Quality Gates

```
Development Phase Gates:
├── Requirements Review (All agents input)
├── Design Review (Frontend + Fullstack)
├── Implementation Review (Code Review agent)
├── Testing Review (Testing agent)
└── Deployment Review (DevOps agent)
```

- Stakeholder satisfaction maintained
- Technical debt kept under control

## Escalation Procedures

### Issue Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: Production down, security breach, data loss
2. **High**: Feature blocking, performance degradation

4. **Low**: Improvement suggestions, technical debt

### Escalation Timeline

- **Critical**: Immediate (within 1 hour)
- **High**: Same day (within 4 hours)
- **Medium**: Within 24 hours
- **Low**: Next planning session

## Commands and Tools
